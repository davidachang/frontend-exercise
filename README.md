# Frontend Exercise

This exercise is intended for you to get familiar with fundamental [React](https://reactjs.org/) concepts in an interactive way, as well as for you to get comfortable developing in a modern [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) environment. 

This project will be broken down into multiple parts. Each part will cover a fundamental React/frontend concept. After you finish this project, submit a pull request and assign your tech lead to review it!

### Getting Help
We understand that a lot of you are new to React and frontend development in general. We think going through this exercise will really help you get up to speed in order to start being productive contributing to your nonprofit project. 

[The Beginner's Guide to React](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-reactjs) will be very beneficial to go through to get a complete understanding on React fundamentals. We also want you to get comfortable diving into [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) and [Javascript Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference) as part of this exercise. 

A lot of what makes a good software developer is being resourceful and knowing where/how to find information you need. At the same time, the entire Hack4Impact community is available if you get stuck, have unanswered questions, or want to discuss anything!

If you have any questions about javascript as a language and its features or syntax, ask/discuss in the `#javascript` Slack channel.

If you have any questions about React, styling, or other frontend related concerns, ask/discuss in the `#frontend` Slack channel.

And of course, if you are already familiar with this or have figured it out, please also hop in these channels and help those who need it! :)

### Requirements
* node version 8.x
* npm version 5.x

Install node and npm [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Check if you have the correct versions by running the following commands in your terminal:
```
node -v
```
```
npm -v
```

### Setup

Open up your terminal and navigate to the directory you want this project in. Then clone this repository by running:
```
git clone https://github.com/hack4impact-uiuc/frontend-exercise.git
```

Go into the newly cloned directory:
```
cd frontend-exercise
```

Install project dependencies:
```
npm install
```
 
After that's done, run this to start development:
```
npm start
```

This will start running the app and automatically open it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Anytime you change and save the code, it will automatically reload!

### Optional Setup
Prettier is a tool that automatically reformats your code to follow a certain set of coding style guidelines. It is configured to run automatically before each commit. This makes sure all of our code follows the same code styles, enforcing good practices and minimizing conflicts.

It is definitely not necessary for this exercise, but there are prettier plugins you can install for your editor. See instructions [here](https://github.com/prettier/prettier#editor-integration).
