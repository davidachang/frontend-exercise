# Frontend Exercise

## Requirements
* node version 8
* npm version 5

Install node and npm [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Check if you have the correct versions by running the following commands in your terminal:
```
node -v
```
```
npm -v
```

## Setup

### `npm install`
Installs dependencies. Should only be required during initial setup or when new dependencies are added.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Additional Setup
Prettier is a tool that automatically reformats your code to follow a certain set of coding style guidelines. It is configured to run automatically before each commit. This makes sure all of our code follows the same code styles, enforcing good practices and minimizing conflicts.

It is definitely not necessary for this exercise, but there are prettier plugins you can install for your editor. See instructions [here](https://github.com/prettier/prettier#editor-integration)
